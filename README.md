# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

After reviewing the previous rideshare analysis, some trends were found between the various city types. For a more in-depth look at each city type, a separate analysis had to be performed. The goal of further parsing through this data is to use the patterns by city type to expand on current polices and properly allocate drivers so as to maximize profit. 

## Results 

It is clear that there are too many drivers in rural areas. While the rural areas seem to deliver the most consistency in ride fares, the fare per ride is the lowest of the three city types. In addition to that, the driver count is the highest, indicating a clear oversaturation in the driver labor market. Urban areas have the highest fare per driver but the lowest total fare amount. Compared to rural areas, it’s nearly a tenth of the total fares. This could indicate a shortage in drivers, or is caused by other factors such as public transportation substitutes. It’s clear that certain weeks produce similar upticks in rides requested between all city types. For instance, the data indicate the third week in February saw fare increases across the board. 

## Summary

Some recommended plans of action are to allocate more drivers to urban areas. While it is possible that public transportation might be taking some business away from the drivers, these areas should be more populated than rural types. In general, the discrepancy between the two should not be so pronounced. Additionally, drivers should be encouraged to work during peak times, such as the third week of February. Lastly, the fares by city type do not show themselves to be very responsive during peak times of year. Also, prices need to be raised. The average fare per driver for both rural and suburban areas is not even enough to cover operating costs.
